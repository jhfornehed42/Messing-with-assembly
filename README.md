# Messing-with-assembly

Just some little programs made in x86 NASM Linux assembly
I will include a bash script to assemble, link, and run all programs in this repository
To install the NASM assembler, simply run the command "sudo apt install nasm"
After installing NASM, there shouldn't be anything else you have to install to run these

  1. Hello - Simple IO program that takes in a user's name, and says "Hello <name>". To run, run the command "./build.sh hello"
